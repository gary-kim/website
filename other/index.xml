# Intro to Git
by Gary Kim
***
### What is Git?
**
Git is a (distributed) version control system.
**
Essentially, Git keeps track of every version of your file that you have "committed". This lets you, for example, remove a change that you made that you know introduced a bug.
**
Git also allows multiple people to work on the same code at the same time by allowing people to make changes on their own local systems then having code to combine changes from multiple people. This process is called merging.
***
### Pro Git 2nd Edition
A lot of the information in this presentation is from the Pro Git 2nd Edition book. If you're interested in Git after this presentation, I'd recommend reading Pro Git and the source code of Git available at &lt;https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git>
***
### What we are covering
**
#### Git Porcelain Commands
```bash
git add
git commit
git checkout
git branch
git log
git reset
```
and many more
***
## Creating a Repo
**
#### TL;DR
```bash
mkdir reponame
cd reponame
git init
```
**
Running the command `git init` will make the current directory that you are in a Git repository.
***
## Status
**
One of the most useful commands in Git
```
git status
```
This will show you the current state of your Git repo and tells you how to do things that you may be looking to do.
**
#### Example output
```
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
(use "git add &lt;file>..." to update what will be committed)
(use "git checkout -- &lt;file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
modified: content/other/intro-to-git.html
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```
***
## Making changes and committing them
**
#### TL;DR
Make your change then
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Commit message"
```
**
To make a commit, you will need to make a change, add that change to the staging area, then commit the change.
**
1. Make whatever changes you want
2. Add add changes to the staging area by running
```
git add -A
```
3. Commit your changes with
```
git commit -m "Commit message"
```
**
Keep in mind that Git stores files, not directories (folders). If you want an empty directory, the convention is to place an empty file in the directory called `.gitkeep` so Git keeps a record of it.
**
Typing `git log` will show you the history of commits in the repo that led up to the commit that you currently have checked out.

**
The more inquisitive among you will be asking why it is the staging area exists. You don't actually have to commit every change you made in one go. If you think it makes more sense to separate the changes you made into different commits, you can `git add` only the files you want to commit. You can even only commit some of the changes you made in a single file by using `git add -p`.
***
## Branches
**
#### TL;DR
New branch with current checked out commit
```
git checkout -b branch-name
```
Checkout to another branch
```
git checkout branch-name
```
**
Git includes the concept of branches which you can think of as different versions (or "editions") of your software. They allow for you and multiple other people to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously without them interfering with each other.
**
Use `git checkout -b branch-name` to make a new branch. Once you make a new branch, you can make commits in this branch.
**
The main branch is called `master` by convention though some projects are changing to using `main` in order to avoid potentially causing issues by referencing a master-slave relationship.
**
Fun fact: `git checkout -b branch-name` is actually a shortcut for typing
```
git branch branch-name # Create a branch with the name branch-name
git checkout branch-name # Switch to the branch named branch-name
```
***
## Remotes
**
Git has a built in feature for having `remotes`. These remotes are essentially places where you can push and pull your Git repo from.
**
There are many different Git servers available. Some commercial, most open-source, some paid, some free, and so on.
**
[GitHub](https://github.com) is one of the most popular ones, especially for those making open source software.
Shameless plug: I'm also going to shout out [Gitea](https://gitea.io) as I am a maintainer for Gitea.
**
To download a repo to your computer from a Git server, use the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/gary-kim/website
```
This will create a new directory with the repository.
**
You can push new commits you may have made to a branch by using the following:
```
git push origin branch-name [--set-upstream]
```
You can also add the `--set-upstream` flag so that next time you want to push this branch, you can simply use the following:
```
git push
```
**
#### Pull Changes
To pull new changes into your current branch from the remote, run the following command:
```
git pull
```
**
#### Fetch Changes
If you want to only fetch changes and leave your local branch untouched, use the following:
```
git fetch
```
**
#### Edit remotes
Editing remotes is a relatively advanced thing to do but here are the basics:
```
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote add origin https://git.garykim.dev/gary-kim/at-psychology-writeup
git remote remove upstream
```
***
## Common Operations
**
#### Make a change and push it to a remote
The most common operation you are going to do for class is to commit a change and push it to a remote. In the default setup for Git, the following commands will work:
```
git add -A
git commit -m "Commit message"
git push origin &lt;branch-name>
```
**
#### Amend latest commit
If you made a mistake in your last commit, you can fix your mistake then "amend" your last commit to include your fix by adding the `--amend` flag to your commit command.
```
git add -A
git commit --amend
```
If you have already pushed to your git remote, you're going to have to force push. Otherwise, your git remote will refuse to receive a commit that does have the commit it already has.
```
git push --force-with-lease
```
**
#### Revert a commit
If you need to undo a change that you made, you can use this command:
```
git revert &lt;commit-hash>
```
This will add a revert commit that undoes the changes that were made in that commit. Future changes will be left alone.
**
#### Checkout a commit
If you want to see what your repo was like after a specific commit, use the following command:
```
git checkout &lt;commit-hash>
```
**
#### Diff a commit
If you want to see the difference between two versions of your software, use the following command:
```
git diff &lt;commit-hash-1> &lt;commit-hash-2>
```
You can see the difference between your edited files and your staging area by using this command:
```
git diff [--cached]
```
Add `--cached` to see the difference between your staging area and your latest commit.
**
#### Rebase
You can use the rebase command to reapply the changes you made on top of another version of the repository. This is useful for if you have unintentionally allowed your local branch and remote branch to diverge, for example.
```
git rebase origin/master
```
WARNING: will likely require manual changes during the process.
**
#### Squash
Git has the ability to combine multiple commits into one.
```
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```
with '3' being the number of commits behind you want to edit.
Keep in mind, you are changing your repository history by doing this and will need to force push if you already force pushed your previous changes to a remote.
Continued on the next page
**
#### Interactive Rebase
While the last slide showed how to squash commits, the same command is used for when you want to edit a part of your Git history for one reason or another.
WARNING: if you accidentally committed a secret and pushed it, changing history and force pushing it will not remove the data from your remote. If this happens, consider the secret no longer secret.
***
## Internals of Git
At this point, you should have everything you need to use Git in your everyday life.
If you stay, we are going to take a deep dive into how Git stores data internally.
***
Take a look in one of your Git repositories, specifically, in the `.git` directory.

Let's go through the important files and directories in here one by one
**
From Pro Git 2nd Edition
![](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/data-model-4.png)
***
### objects
**
The `objects` directory actually contains pretty much all the information in the Git repo. There are 3 different types of objects:
* blob
* tree
* commit
**
The data is stored in a simple key-value format. Every file has a hash that is calculated from the file contents and extra header information. That hash is the key of the object with the value being the actual contents of the object.
**
The way that the objects are stored are such that they can be found by going into the directory of the first 2 characters of the hash, then the next 38 characters (the hash is always 40 characters long).
For example, `00a5a73587b4d2623b73fd2a9dacff06678f2972` will be found at `.git/objects/00/a5a73587b4d2623b73fd2a9dacff06678f2972`
**
If you know the hash of an object, you can print out the contents of the object.
```
$ git cat-file -p 73ab8769f93bbbd5c4b69d33c2fa86329d05bc85
public/
resources/
```
**
***
### objects: blob
**
The contents of the files in a repository are stored in blob objects. Some header information about the object and the file contents are appended together then compressed using zlib for storage.
***
### objects: tree
**
Trees in Git can be thought of like a directory. They contain references to other trees and blobs that they contain.
**

***
## Objects: Commit
**
Commit objects refer to a commit. They contain information about the commit, the commit that came before it, and points to a tree that points to the correct versions of all the files in the repository.

**
Because the hash of the commit is based on the hash of the previous commit and the tree's hash which is based on the exact layout and contents of the repository, no change can be made in a repository's history without changing these hashes. A change in a commit hash is very obvious to anyone else that may be working with the project.
***
## refs
**
You may be thinking, if all data is stored in a key-value store, how does Git know where to start for any operation. This is where `refs` come into play. Inside the `refs` directory, you will find references to keys to look in the key value store for.
**
```

**
This is actually all branches are. `refs` to different commits.
***
## Packfiles
**
You would have noticed that because of the way Git stores data, the smallest change to a file results in the file being resaved again. This takes up a lot of storage. Packfiles exist to fix this problem.
**
Packfiles are files that each store many objects. Packfiles are capable of storing diffs between versions rather than storing entire files. This is how Git can work on large repositories without quickly growing out of control.
