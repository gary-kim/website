# Intro to Git
by Gary Kim

***

### What is Git?

**

Git is a (distributed) version control system.

**

Essentially, Git keeps track of every version of your file that you have "committed". This lets you, for example, remove a change that you made that you know introduced a bug.

**

Git also allows multiple people to work on the same code at the same time by allowing people to make changes on their own local systems then having code to combine changes from multiple people. This process is called merging.

***

### Pro Git 2nd Edition

A lot of the information in this presentation is from the Pro Git 2nd Edition book. If you're interested in Git after this presentation, I'd recommend reading Pro Git and the source code of Git available at <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git>

### What we are covering

**

#### Git Porcelain Commands

```bash
git add
git commit
git checkout
git branch
git log
git reset
```

and many more

## Internals of Git

At this point, you should have everything you need to use Git in your everyday life.
If you stay, we are going to take a deep dive into how Git stores data internally.

***

Take a look in one of your Git repositories, specifically, in the `.git` directory.

Let's go through the important files and directories in here one by one

***

### objects

**

The `objects` directory actually contains pretty much all the information in the Git repo. There are 3 different types of objects:

* blob
* tree
* commit
