Just a few fun constructions made in [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim). Manim (Math Animation Engine) <cite href="https://github.com/3b1b/manim">is an animation engine for explanatory math videos</cite> made by [3Blue1Brown](www.3blue1brown.com) (Grant Sanderson) and available under the MIT license.

**There's a few more that I'm currently working on. I'll add them here as they get finished.**

All the scripts used to make these videos are avaliable [here](https://git.garykim.dev/gary-kim/trying-manim).

## Compass and Straight Edge

#### Perpendicular Bisector

Given a line, draw its perpendicular bisector.

#### Parallel Line on a Point

Given a line and a point not on the line, draw a line that is parallel and goes through the give point.

#### Angle Bisector

Given an angle, draw its bisector.

#### Regular Pentagon Starting With a Side

Given a line, draw a regular pentagon for which the given line would be a side.

## 3D Constructions

What can you make in 3 dimentions with just spheres? 

#### Plane to Perpendicular Line

Given a plane, draw a line that is perpendicular to the plane.

#### Line to Perpendicular Plane

Given a line, draw a plane that is perpendicular to the line.

## Trying to figure out how to use Manim

#### Following Getting Started

Just trying to figure out what is capable with Manim.

{{< video mp4="/res/large/manim-constructions/EnterScene.mp4" >}}

#### GraphScene Example

Messing with `GraphScene` in Manim.

#### Trying to Make a 3D Scene (didn't really work)

First attempt at trying to use `Special3DScene`.
