If you need to get in contact with me, I will be the fastest responding to my email, [gary@garykim.dev](mailto:gary@garykim.dev), and Matrix, [@gary:garykim.dev](https://matrix.to/#/@gary:garykim.dev).

I am also available on {{< social "linkedin" />}}.

{{<social "github">}} GitHub {{</social>}} does not have a messaging system, but I am pretty active there as well.

I am also on {{<social "gitlab" >}} Gitlab {{</social>}}.

You can contact me on {{<social "discord" >}} Discord {{</social>}} ({{<social "discord" />}}) but keep in mind, I will be very slow to respond and I also likely will not respond if I don't know you.
